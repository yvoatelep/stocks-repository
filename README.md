# Refactor VBA Code and Measure Performance

## Overview of Project
The goal of this analysis is to examine stock performance in the years 2017 and 2018, as well as to measure the efficiency of refactored code compared to the original script created through the module. 

### Results
According to the analysis, 2017 was a much better year for this collection of stock than was 2018. We can see that 83% of the stocks analyzed fell in value in 2018, 40% of them losing 40% or more of their value.

By contrast, 93% of those same stocks gained value in 2017, with 37% of them providing over 100% return.

Because my challenge code did not run successfully, I am not able to esxamine the differences in execution time between the original and the refactored script. (Above images are from my original module work. I included these because they did run correctily and I could use them to analyze the stocks.) ) 

## Summary

At this time, I can't comment on the advantages of refactoring code because my refactored code did not run successfully, except to say that it is a learning experience and could well yield better results if done correctly. The disadvantage is that it is time consuming to change code that already works and it could be risky. 
It's wise to mitigate that risk by commenting your original code so that it can be preserved in case your new code does not run correctly. 

In my case, the original script was much more advantageous, simply because it was more straightforward and worked for me. I found the most interesting thing about the deliverable here was that it became interactive, so that the end user could make use of it again and again with new data sets and 
get clear, formatted results with the click of a button. If the refactored code works eventually, the code could be even more valuable to the user as more data could be added and more stocks could be analyzed.
